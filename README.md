# H-wind
The Hurricane Research Division produced surface wind analysis of tropical cyclones from 1993 - 2013 as part of the H*Wind Project.


In 2014, this technology was transferred to Hwind Scientific, a US private sector firm as allowed under the Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 US Code 3710). Hwind Scientific is now Moody's RMS HWind.


Their real-time and post storm wind field products are available at www.rms.com/event-response/hwind


RMS Hwind will also offer a revised historical archive with user support, time-centered, post storm analyses, larger domains, higher resolution grids, consistent analysis methodologies, and error corrections.
